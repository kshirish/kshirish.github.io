He is unaware of flipkart's newly launched gadgets

Probably never heard of barbeque

He is too busy pleasing his lords

making his way towards a few pennies

with shaking hands which cannot differentiate

between pizza and burger.

You see, his lords are toiling under aircondition

in the midday of this savage afternoon. 

His eyes are a bit fuzzy

cannot see the gold in the world's eyes.

the anosmic brute never judged a man

by his deodrant.

How careless a human can be? 

How a person can be so unworldy?

You're right, these monkey-men need to be

supervised to keep in order.
