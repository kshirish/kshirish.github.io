This blog is not my [first attempt](http://kisleyshirish.blogspot.in/) at writing, I have been doing this for a couple of years now. But now I want to take this frequent jaunt to a next level - hoping I will learn and grow better.
Writing just doesn't acquaint you with yourself but it tends to grow you better, therefore [you should write daily](http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/)  .
